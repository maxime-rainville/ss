# SS Command
Maxime's magical Silverstripe CMS Helper command.

It's meant to make it easy to set up a new Silverstripe CMS dev site using my highly idiosyncratic set up.

The two main thing it does right now are:
- `ss-cli env` creates an environment file
- `ss-cli host` adds the current site base URL to the host file
